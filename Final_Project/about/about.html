        	<h3>Bio</h3>
			<p>Courtney Farren is a San Francisco Bay Area born and raised singer/songwriter. When performing, her comedic, story-telling stage banter somehow works to accent her often personal and heartbreaking lyrics. Though personal, Courtney does a great job at making you feel included in the raw emotions she shares. She has said that she doesn't attach herself to one genre, but that's really only because she's always had trouble spelling genre. Her sound is often considered complementary to artists like Birdy and Daughter. </p>

			<p>August of 2016, she teamed up with a close friend of hers to begin her venture into recording, and co-produced an indie album that is now going through mixing. She is currently in San Francisco working with a San Francisco based producer to complete an album.</p>

			<p>She is a member of the West Coast Songwriters Association and the recipient of multiple "Best Song of the Month" and "Best Performance" awards from the Redwood City and Palo Alto chapters she regularly attends. During the yearly West Coast Songwriter Conference she received an honorable mention from 4 of the invited panelists. </p>

			<p>Also she wrote this. She is me. I wrote this.</p>

			<p>Hi,</p>

			<p>I make music because I have to. Also I'm crazy.</p>

			<p>I've been singing for as long as I can remember to every song that ever came on the radio while in the car - whether I knew the song or not - and I have yet to stop. By the time I was 6 years old my parents took note of this unrelenting habit of mine and bribed me with video games to take singing lessons. I began taking lessons with a coach in my area, and for a few weeks I took advantage of the new game every lesson deal. Eventually, though, I began to feel bad about enjoying the lessons *and* enjoying the new video games... I told my parents no more games were required to get me to my lessons. But - again - this was after I scored Zoombinis, Pajama Sam, Sonic Adventure Battle 2, and Super Monkey Ball, so I'm no hero. </p>

			<p>At the time, I was my teacher's youngest student. I would bring in songs that had to be raised to pitches that made the tracks sound like mice. One of the first songs I remember bringing in was "Vertigo" by U2, and I still have my lesson CDs (yes I'm old enough to at least have experienced the CD days) of my tiny voice singing "uno, dos, tres, catorze!"</p>

			<p>At 6, my family and I lived with my grandparents, so I was always listening to their music. Possibly out of necessity - I grew to love it. Johnny Cash, Elvis, Sinatra, Dean Martin, Fleetwood Mac, Dido, The Carpenters, Johnny Mathis - the list goes on. One of these artists was always playing in the house, and - because my grandparents moved to the states with my dad from Ireland - so were bands like U2 and Celtic Woman. Primarily, though, it was my older brother who influenced the music I listened to. Bands like Good Charlotte, Green Day, and Simple Plan were always in line to be played on my CD player (again, yes, I had a yellow CD player - and, yes, my brother listened to typical boy music, so I followed suit). Also - really random - so was the soundtrack to the Charlie's Angels Full Throttle movie? I can't really explain that, but it's got some jams on it. Eventually, I began listening to Eminem and Coldplay (again influenced by my brother) which took up the large majority of my first generation iPod (no more CD player). I've always listened to a wide variety of music, and that has a major impact on the spectrum of music I listen to and create today. </p>

			<p>I currently listen to a lot of random music all across the board - largely because of how easy it's become to find and listen to new music. For a long time I was adamant about purchasing artist's albums and songs on iTunes or from the store, but Spotify and Apple Music made me compromise my values in order to save money... Since I love writing lyrics, I really appreciate artists who say things in ways I hadn't considered. I also kind of enjoy being sad... So melodic and ambient songs are usually my go-tos. Contrary to that, I can often be found listening to rap because I think that could be my backup career if I tried hard enough - right behind dancing which I'm phenomenal at... Oh! Or comedy - I'm funny. Anyways, listening to music is a very emotional process for me (as are most things I enjoy doing because I'm a very emotional person), but it allows me to fully appreciate the world I live in. A place where I am free and able to be anyone I'd like to be, and to find out who that is. I know I wouldn't be able to do that without music. I also wouldn't be able to put headphones in and dance/sing in public while people question my sanity. So, there we go. </p>

			<p>As far as writing goes - I began writing songs at 15 years old after having spent a few years experimenting with poems and creative writing. I started writing a lot of poems freshman year of high school and a few months into doing that I brought one in to my singing teacher (same one from when I was 6) wondering how I could turn it into a song. She said she'd been waiting for that, and we spent the majority of the next year and a half writing songs together while I picked up the guitar and taught myself the basics. Since then - I've been obsessed with lyrics and writing. </p>

			<p>So I write about sad things(often), happy things(sometimes), interesting things(of course - always), anything (very literally anything)... And then I sing it. That's it really. I draw inspiration from the people and events that make up my life, grab my guitar (or sit at my piano), and write. It's really fun and incredibly therapeutic; you should try it. Of course, if you don't want to try it, you could just listen to my music. Actually - you should do that anyways. </p>

			<p>My dream is to connect with as many people as possible, so I'd love to hear from you. Send me emails at courtney@courtneyfarren.com! </p>

			 
			<p>I love you,</p>
			<p><b>Courtney</b></p>
